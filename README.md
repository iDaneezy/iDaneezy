1. I hope to do Computer Science as a course in University, with the goal of one day becoming a Software Engineer
2. Currently, I am learning how to improve my CV and get better at interviews with my work-experience at Sparta Global. 
3. I hope to study more programming languages to further my programming skills. I also hope to study people in the work industry, and learn more in detail, the hard and soft skills needed in a business.
